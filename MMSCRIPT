MMSCRIPT

MMScript is the internal scripting language for the Manmonth system. It is used for:
* the parameters of the action associated with a rule
* the trigger that decides if a rule should run
* the title of a record

Each MMScript runs in a context where one or more records are available to query.
Each record in the context will have been automatically assigned a name, eg 'user' or 'actor'.

Order of precidence

This is the order in which parts of an MMScript are resolved, like in mathematics when multiply and divide is always done before plus and minus.

| : Boolean OR
& : Boolean AND
< > = <= >= <> : Comparisons. Greater than, less than, equals, smaller or equal, greater or equal, not equal
! : Boolean NOT
- : Unary minus. eg. -X. Not the same as subtraction, eg. X-Y
+ - : Addition and subtraction.
* / : Multiplication and division
^ : Power operator. eg. X^4 is the same as X*X*X*X
( ) : Brackets
-> <- : Follow a named link forward or back from a record. Can only be used when the result will be maximum 1 records based on the link min/max settings. eg. actor->group.name
. : access a property of a record eg. user.name
func() : Function calls
, : List seperator

Literals

Literal values are any of
boolean : eg. true, false
string : eg. 'fish', 'hello world', ''
integer : eg. 1234, 99, -100, 0
decimal : eg. 1.123, 99.0, -23.0
null : eg. null

Functions

Function allow for more complicated operations. New functions can be added into the App/MMScript/Funcs directory.

Casting functions

string( x ) : turns x into a string
decimal( x ) : turns x into a decimal. Defaults to zero if it can't parse the value.

Numerical functions

floor( x ) : rounds a decimal down to the nearest smaller integer. 5=>5, 6.1=>6, 7.5=>7, 8.9=>8, 0=>0, -1.1=>-2.
ceil( x ) : rounds a decimal down to the nearest larger integer. 5=>5, 6.1=>7, 7.5=>8, 8.9=>9, 0=>0, -1.1=>-1.
round( x ) : rounds a decimal down to the nearest integer. 5=>5, 6.1=>6, 7.5=>8, 8.9=>9, 0=>0, -1.1=>-1. IMPORTANT: -1.5 rounds to -2.
min( a,b,... ) : returns the smallest of a set of decimal/interger values.
max( a,b,... ) : returns the largest of a set of decimal/interger values.

Control functions

if( test, a, b ) : returns a if the test is true, otherwise b.

Other functions

set( x ) : returns true if x is not null at runtime.

Equivalence

Decimal & Integers may be compared, but some functions are more explicit. if() won't let you mix decimal and integer results.

NULL

The null literal can be compared to anything. Note that null is equal to '' and 0 and false.
To detect a null explicitly, use isset(). This can be used to distinguish no data from unset data.
